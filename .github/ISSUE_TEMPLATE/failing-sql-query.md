# Description

I tried using `sqlitis` to convert a SQL query and received an error.

## Failing command (required)

```
FIXME: PASTE SQLITIS COMMAND AND FULL OUTPUT HERE
```

## Debug Logs (required)

*Instructions: Re-run the `sqlitis` command with the `--debug` flag. For example, `sqlitis --debug <YOUR_SQL_QUERY>`.*

```
FIXME: PASTE FULL SQLITIS OUTPUT WHEN USING THE --debug FLAG
```

## Additional details (optional)

*Include any additional details about your issue here*
